## About the paper
This repository is for Time Series Analysis course essay of the 2nd sememster of 2021 to 2022 academic year of the junior class.
## Abstract
*Digital economics*, an important concept in China's 14th Five-Year Plan and 2035 vision goal outline, along with the rise of the concept of *Metaverse* is constantly gaining attention cryptocurrencies (in this paper, take BTC & ETH as examples). Thus, it is of great significance to study the time series data of the trading volume, closing price and other variables of these two cryptocurrencies.
In this paper, seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model, multiple time series cointegration analysis and error correction (ECM-VAR) are modeled. In the last part of paper, using deep learning method to establish LSTM model for prediction.
In conclusion, the time series of BTC & ETH shows instablility and seasonality. Besids, the trading volume of these has a co-integration relationship, in another put, the demand of these exists a long-term equilibrium. The combination of LSTM & SARIMA has potential to predict the closing price and trading volume respectively to obtain greater accuracy.
